nbconvert-tools
===============

This repo contains scripts to convert between Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts.

The default behavior of nbconvert allows one to convert a notebook to a script.
However, this is a one-way transformation. Not enough information to convert
from a script back to a notebook is exported.

This repo provides tools for converting back and forth.
